This site uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
