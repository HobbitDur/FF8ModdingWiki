The World Map is divided in _Regions_, and each _Region_ is made up of different _Ground Types_.  
For each _Ground Type_, 8 different encounter slots are available, and are ordered by rarity: the first 4 are the common encounters, the follow 2 are medium rarity, and the last 2 are rare encounters.  
The following is a list of all the possible encounters in FF8's World Map, with a number next to each [EncounterID](../../Battle/encounter-codes/) to show how many slots contain the ID, since most of the time they're repeated to take up more than one of the eight available slots.
