# Usage
* First you need to extract the kernel.bin file from main.fs, the best tool to do that is [Deling](https://github.com/myst6re/deling/releases). <br/>
You can find the main.fs file in ...\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VIII\Data\lang-xx.<br/>
I recommend doing a backup of main.fi, main.fl and main.fs as all three get modified.

* Once you have done that open the kernel.bin with Doomtrain and edit what you want!

* Save and re-import the kernel.bin into main.fs using [Deling](https://github.com/myst6re/deling/releases) again.
