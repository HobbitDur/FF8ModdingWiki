FF8 monster battle scripts are divided into 5 sections, **init**, **turn**, **counter**, **death** and **pre-counter**.
Each section contains code that is executed at different times during the battle.
- Init: executes once when the monster is loaded into battle.
- Turn: executes once the monster's ATB bar fills. This happens after the monsters turn counter is incremented.
- Counter: executes when the monster is targeted by a battle command.
- Death: executes when the monsterâ€™s HP reaches 0 or it is afflicted with the *Death* status.  (Eject may not trigger this section - this needs further testing.)
- Pre-Counter: similar to counter but executed before it. Needs further testing. Seems to be used mostly for checking if the monster has the *Death* status and then change its animation. Ifs, variable assignments and stat changes can also be used. Launching an attack from this section crashes the game.

The order of execution when a monster is attacked is: **pre-counter** -> **death** (if killed) -> **counter**
Note: **pre-counter** code will **ONLY** be executed after an attack that kills a monster if the monster's **death** section has code in it (apart from "return").
Note: if the **death** section is empty, it will function like a **_die_** opcode.
Note: if the **death** section is empty, it is mandatory for it to eventually execute a **_die_** opcode, otherwise the monster will continue, even on 0 HP, making the battle unwinnable for the player and forcing them to run. If running is not an option, this results in a soft locked.

# Opcodes

Monster AI sections are composed of one-byte opcodes, each followed by a variable number of the bytes used as parameters.
These opcodes define the monster's behaviour in battle.
Note: descriptions are written from the monster's perspective, so "opposing party" refers to the party of playable characters.

## Opcode 0x00 (0) - return

### Summary

| Opcode | IfritAI name | Size | Short Description  |
|--------|--------------|------|--------------------|
| 0x00   | return       | 1    | End monster's turn |

This opcode is used to end the monster's turn, preventing further execution of code.
It is mandatory for every battle script section to end with a **_return_**.

### Parameters

None

## Opcode 0x01 (1) - print

### Summary

| Opcode | IfritAI name | Size | Short Description   |
|--------|--------------|------|---------------------|
| 0x01   | print        | 2    | Print text          |

### Parameters

| Position | Size | Name       | Type                     | Short Description     |
|----------|------|------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1        | 1    | **TextID** | [int](../OpCodeType#int) | The index of the text |

Texts are defined in [section 7](../FileFormat_DAT#section-7-informations--stats) of c0mxxx.dat files.  
Each text has an ID, starting from 0 and incrementing with each subsequent text.  
**TextID** correspond to this ID.

---

## Opcode 0x02 (2) - if

### Summary
The if opcode allows code to execute only when specific conditions are met.

| Opcode | IfritAI name | Size | Short Description |
|--------|--------------|------|-------------------|
| 0x02   | if           | 1    | Define condition  |

### Parameters

The if opcode is a really complex one with lots of different possibilities.  
The first parameter is the if type, theres many different types that can be used to check different proprieties,
sometimes this doubles as the subject, in these cases 
So it does something like this: \[LeftCondition\] \[Comparator\] \[RightCondition\], for ex: COMBAT SCENE == 76  
Then there is a jump param to define the jump size if the condition is not met  

| Position | Size | Name               | Yype                                   | Short Description                                    |
|----------|------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1    | **SubjectID**      | [SubjectID](#subjectid)                | Define what the if will be about                     |
| 2        | 1    | **LeftCondition**  | Vary                                   | The left condition                                   |
| 3        | 1    | **Comparator**     | [Comparator](../OpCodeType#comparator) | The comparator of the condition                      |
| 4        | 1    | **RightCondition** | Vary                                   | The right condition                                  |
| 5        | 1    | **Padding**        | [Unused](../OpCodeType#unused)         | Always 0x00 (changing it has no impact)              |
| 6        | 2    | **Jump**           | [int](../OpCodeType#int)               | The number of byte to jump if the condition is false |

### SubjectID
The **SubjectID** defines what will be the type of the left and right condition  
The _Short text_ is a description of the subject id.  
The _Left text_ is the meaning of the **LeftCondition**. {} is to be replaced with the value hold by **LeftCondition** depending of _Param left type_  
The _Param left type_ define the type to use to translate the **LeftCondition**  
Same logic for the **RightCondition**  
The _Param list_ can feed the param type with additional info.  

| SubjectID | Short text                | Left text                           | Param left type                                                    | Right text     | Param right type         | Param list |
